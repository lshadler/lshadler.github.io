### Welcome to the release of "Style Boyz: The Game"!

After months of really lazy and laid-back development, (mostly) Jamey and I have put
together a new level for everyone! We want your feedback, and hope to be making some
awesome boss fights with better jokes now that the groundwork has been completed in
getting the game moving.

### Installing the game

#### Windows

[Click Here](https://github.com/Jameywags/style_boyz_the_game/releases/download/0.1.0/Style.Boyz.The.Game.Win.exe)
to get started with our awesome game!

#### Mac

[Click Here](https://github.com/Jameywags/style_boyz_the_game/releases/download/0.1.0/Style.Boyz.The.Game.Mac.zip)
and unzip the `.app` file. From there, "right-click" on the `.app` file and click "Show Package Contents".
Navigate to the `Contents/MacOS/` folder and double-click the `Style_Boyz_The_Game` file. When the dialog opens
up, click "Open" (Hopefully you will trust us :D). If no dialog appears, or the dialog displays a notification
related to "Damaged files", you will need to loosen the security settings of your system.

### References
The game was created using Game Maker Studio 2 and 
the project is open source and can be viewed on
[Github](https://github.com/Jameywags/style_boyz_the_game).
