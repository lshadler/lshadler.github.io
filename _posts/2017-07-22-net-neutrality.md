title: "A Comment on Net Neutrality"
---
With ISPs using a [great deal of money](https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/29/15100620/congress-fcc-isp-web-browsing-privacy-fire-sale) to lobby against Neutrality, I thought that I should do my part to help shed some light on the subject.

First off, for people who are a little iffy on the topic, I have a few articles. The [wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality) provides a sufficient overview of the concepts and stipulations of a neutral stance towards the internet. Veronica Belmont discusses the history
and potential impacts of net neutrality in her [podcast](https://irlpodcast.org/episode2/). It’s an excellent 25-minute cast you can listen to on
a ride and feel informed. In short, Net Neutrality is the idea that all data on the internet is treated equally, preventing ISPs from controlling
the flow of data for the users they provide internet access to.

On one hand, we do not have to fear for any blocking or throttling of our internet access, which is one main concern for the pro-neutrality agenda.
These moves by ISPs would be in violation of competition laws and would be quickly shut down if ever attempted. However, charging premiums for internet
access alone will be harmful for businesses, schools, and startups that lack the funding to perform research/business/development while also fronting
the cost of communication and information.

We are at a turning point in futurism. The laws laid down and modified today will decide who gets to manipulate the foundations of the way we interact
with people and one of the biggest changes in human lifestyle. A few of my closest friends I haven’t even met in real life due to the incredible
freedoms of an open internet. Let’s make sure we are informed of the changing of the rules that govern the internet, and ensure that our desires as
a nation on the topic are met.
