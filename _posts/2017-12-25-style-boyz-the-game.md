### Welcome to the release of "Style Boyz: The Game"!

After a month of really lazy and laid-back development, Jamey and I made
a basic tutorial level of the game we intend to work on over the next year!
We have laid out the basic functionality of the three main characters, build
a solid base of enemy layout, and worked on some game design features that will
propagate through future releases. As it matures, we hope to fill our game with
inside jokes, and get friendly input into the design of the levels!

### Installing the game

#### Windows

[Click Here](https://github.com/Jameywags/style_boyz_the_game/releases/download/0.0.1/StyleBoyzTheGame.exe) 
to get started with our awesome game!

#### Mac

[Click Here](https://github.com/Jameywags/style_boyz_the_game/releases/download/0.0.1/StyleBoyzTheGame.app.zip) 
and unzip the `.app` file. From there, "right-click" on the `.app` file and click "Show Package Contents". 
Navigate to the `Contents/MacOS/` folder and double-click the `Style_Boyz_The_Game` file. When the dialog opens 
up, click "Open" (Hopefully you will trust us :D). If no dialog appears, or the dialog displays a notification
related to "Damaged files", you will need to loosen the security settings of your system.
