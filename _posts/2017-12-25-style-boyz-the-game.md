### Welcome to the release of "Style Boyz: The Game"!

After a month of really lazy and laid-back development, Jamey and I made
a basic tutorial level of the game we intend to work on over the next year!
We have laid out the basic functionality of the three main characters, build
a solid base of enemy layout, and worked on some game design features that will
propagate through future releases. As it matures, we hope to fill our game with
inside jokes, and get friendly input into the design of the levels!

[Click Here](https://lukeshadler.tech/assets/Style%20Boyz%20The%20Game.exe) to get started with our awesome game!

The game was created using [Game Maker Studio 2](https://docs2.yoyogames.com/) and the project is open source
and can be viewed on [Github](https://github.com/Jameywags/style_boyz_the_game).
