### Welcome to the release of "Style Boyz: The Game"!

After a month of really lazy and laid-back development, Jamey and I made
a basic tutorial level of the game we intend to work on over the next year!
We have laid out the basic functionality of the three main characters, build
a solid base of enemy layout, and worked on some game design features that will
propagate through future releases. As it matures, we hope to fill our game with
inside jokes, and get friendly input into the design of the levels!

### Installing the game
#### Windows
[Click Here](https://github.com/Jameywags/style_boyz_the_game/releases/download/0.0.1/Style.Boyz.The.Game.exe) 
to get started with our awesome game!
#### Mac
Because Apple likes to charge $100 for just about anything, we are only able to make a windows executable at
this time. If you are on a Mac and would like to give the game a go, please use
[Wine](https://www.howtogeek.com/263211/how-to-run-windows-programs-on-a-mac-with-wine/) to get the app running
on your machine.

### Acknowledgements
The game was created using [Game Maker Studio 2](https://docs2.yoyogames.com/) and 
the project is open source and can be viewed on 
[Github](https://github.com/Jameywags/style_boyz_the_game).
